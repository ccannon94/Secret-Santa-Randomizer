# Secret Santa Randomizer

This is a quick tool I put together to email everyone in a Secret Santa gift exchange who their assigned person is. There are two input files required that I left out of this repository for privacy purposes. They should be provided as the first and second command line arguments, respectively. Additionally, there is a custom subject line and body text in the program that must be changed before use.

1. **List of Participants** - This should have each participant's name and email, separated by a comma. Each participant should be on a new line.

```
person1, person1@gmail.com
person2, person2@yahoo.com
person3, person3@aol.com
```

2. **Email Configuration File** - This should have the senders email address, password, and the desired subject line separated by a new line.
